# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The cart size selection functionality in the Deportes GÃ¼emes web store is not working properly. When users add products to their cart and attempt to select different sizes, the selection state is not being updated or displayed correctly. This creates a poor user experience where customers cannot properly specify which sizes they want for their products.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to select specific sizes for products in my cart, so that I can purchase the exact variants I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a size button in the cart THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the selected size
2. WHEN a user selects a size THEN the system SHALL update the cart item data with the selected size
3. WHEN a user changes size selection THEN the system SHALL update the price if different sizes have different prices
4. WHEN a user selects a size THEN the system SHALL persist the selection until the user changes it or removes the item

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see which sizes I have selected for each product in my cart, so that I can verify my selections before checkout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their cart THEN the system SHALL display the currently selected size for each product
2. WHEN no size is selected THEN the system SHALL show a clear indication that size selection is required
3. WHEN multiple sizes are available THEN the system SHALL show all available options with clear visual distinction between selected and unselected
4. WHEN a size is out of stock THEN the system SHALL disable that size option and show stock status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the cart to remember my size selections when I navigate between pages, so that I don't lose my choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects sizes and navigates away from cart THEN the system SHALL preserve the size selections
2. WHEN a user returns to the cart THEN the system SHALL display the previously selected sizes
3. WHEN the browser is refreshed THEN the system SHALL maintain size selections through localStorage
4. WHEN a user adds the same product with different sizes THEN the system SHALL treat them as separate cart items

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want clear feedback when I interact with size selection buttons, so that I understand the system is responding to my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a size button THEN the system SHALL provide visual hover feedback
2. WHEN a user clicks a size button THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual confirmation
3. WHEN a size selection changes the price THEN the system SHALL update the displayed price immediately
4. WHEN a size is unavailable THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate why it cannot be selected
