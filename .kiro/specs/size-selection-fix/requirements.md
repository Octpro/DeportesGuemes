# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Deportes GÃ¼emes sports store application currently displays available sizes as static text but lacks proper interactive size selection functionality. Users need to be able to select specific sizes for products and see visual feedback when sizes are selected, with the selection properly updating the product information and cart functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to select specific sizes for products, so that I can choose the exact size I need before adding items to my cart.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product has multiple sizes available THEN the system SHALL display interactive size selection buttons
2. WHEN a user clicks on a size button THEN the system SHALL visually highlight the selected size
3. WHEN a user selects a different size THEN the system SHALL update the previous selection and highlight the new selection
4. WHEN a size is out of stock THEN the system SHALL disable that size button and show it as unavailable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see clear visual feedback when I select a size, so that I know which size is currently selected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a size is selected THEN the system SHALL apply a distinct visual style to indicate selection
2. WHEN no size is selected THEN the system SHALL show a default state for all size buttons
3. WHEN a size button is hovered THEN the system SHALL show hover feedback
4. WHEN a size is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show a disabled state with appropriate styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the selected size to be remembered when I add products to my cart, so that the correct size variant is added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a size and clicks "CONSULTAR" THEN the system SHALL add the product with the selected size to the cart
2. WHEN no size is selected and the user clicks "CONSULTAR" THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select a size first
3. WHEN a product has only one size available THEN the system SHALL automatically select that size
4. WHEN switching between color variants THEN the system SHALL maintain size selection if the size is available in the new variant

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want size selection to work consistently across different product types, so that I have a uniform shopping experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing products with size variants THEN the system SHALL display size selection buttons consistently
2. WHEN viewing products without size variants THEN the system SHALL not display size selection buttons
3. WHEN switching between products THEN the system SHALL reset size selection for each new product
4. WHEN filtering products by size THEN the system SHALL maintain size selection state for individual products
