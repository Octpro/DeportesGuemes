# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The shopping cart functionality in the Deportes GÃ¼emes web application is currently not working properly. Users are unable to see products they've added to their cart, and the cart always shows as empty even when products have been added. This critical e-commerce functionality needs to be fixed to ensure customers can properly manage their shopping experience.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user visits the cart page THEN the cart SHALL display all previously added products with correct details (name, price, quantity, image)

4. WHEN the cart is empty THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty cart message

2. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser THEN their cart contents SHALL be restored

4. WHEN cart data is saved THEN it SHALL include all necessary product information (id, title, price, quantity, image, variants)

### Requirement 3

### Requirement 5
